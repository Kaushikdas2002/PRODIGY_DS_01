Welcome to my submission of Task 1 of the Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech. This task involves creating visualizations to depict the distribution of population and gender in various countries. Using a dataset from the World Bank, I aim to create meaningful visual representations of the data to understand population dynamics and gender distribution in the top 10 most populous countries.  

## Dataset
The data used for this task is sourced from the World Bank, specifically the total population dataset. You can find the dataset in this repository .
